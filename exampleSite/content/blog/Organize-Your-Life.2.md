**Separating truth from falsehood depends partly on knowing a person, so you can judge if they are behaving differently from usual. With a confident and persuasive talker, especially someone you don't know, how easy is to spot a lie?**

*  The short answer is :- it is difficult. Traditional meaningful signs of lying are shifting gaze to avoid eye contact, folding and unfolding arms, struggling shoulders, and restless hands and feet.
*  However, scientific studies do not support these beliefs. Some honest people are generally nervous and restless. In others, these signs show someone is concentrating on being trustworthy.
*  Polygraph, or lie detector machines :- which record pulse and breathing rates, blood pressure and sweating- have a doubtful history. This is partly due to the stress of using them. Innocent but anxious people can show up as dishonest, while calm, skilled liars pass easily.

**Clues from speech**.

* Speech can be slightly more reliable. Hesitation, repeated words or phrases, breaking up sentences, a change in tone or in speaking speed, and describing unimportant details while avoiding the main topic-are all strategies give time to think and work out which falsehood might be more beleivable.
*  This is true for non-stop liars, who must access memory so as not to deny themselves as their multiple desceptions become ever more twist.

**In Summary:-**

*  **Be very aware of judging someone you don't know well.**
*  **Don't rely on time-honoured signs such as restlessnes and lack of eye contact.**
*  **Clues from speech, such as hesitation and repetition, can be slightly more reliable.**


*  **In many tests, a simple "gut feeling" was as successful as most other methods.**
