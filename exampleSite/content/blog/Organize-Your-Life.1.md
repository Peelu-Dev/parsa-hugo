> As we age, our thinking and short-term memory may become less efficient. Nevertheless, we continue to learn until we die, and we can take active measures to keep our brains working well at any age.

As we get older, most of us notice a slight reduction in thinking speed as well as in our working memory.

1\. Some people experience severe decline or even dementia, but this is by no means inevitable. In fact, some cognitive capacities, such as our overall understanding of life, may even improve as we age.

2\. We inherit our basic level of our cognitive functions from our parents, but this genetic blueprint is also affected by our environment and life experiences, including nutrition, health, education, stress levels and relationships.

3\.Physically, socially, and intellectually stimulating activities also play a key role.

**Preventing Decline**

1\. We can take a variety of steps to safeguard our brain's health. A good diet high in vegetables, fruits, "good" quality fats and nutrients keeps both brain and body healthy, and do moderate but regualr physical activities.

2\. Jogging or other aerobic exercise can help delay age-related declines both in memory and thinking speed.

3\. You can also protect your brain health by avoiding toxins, such as alcohol and tobacco. Smoking has also been linked with damage to the brain's cortex and can decrease the amount of neurons in our brain.

4\. keep your mind stimulated by doing some mental challenge activities that involve learning -"from home repairs to cooking to crossword puzzles-can stretch cognitive skills."

5\. Consider learning a new language, as people who speaks two or more languages have stronger cognitive ability than those who speak just once.

**To sum up, you can slow the cognitive ageing process by following steps:-**

**1. Keeping your brain well supplied with oxygen and nutrients.**

**2. Avoiding exposure to toxins such as alcohol, tobacco and nicotine.**

**3. Exercising your body by building physical activities routine into your daily life.**

**4. Exercising your mind by learning new skills.**
